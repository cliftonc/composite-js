The aim of this project is to create a more 'enterprise' friendly version of a Facebook style Javascript SDK, initially to ensure that it is possible and serves a purpose, and then secondly to understand what is required to pre-build adapters for some common SaaS platforms to integrate from a branding as well as eventing perspective.

e.g. The result will be a very thin layer that enables the embedding of specially crafted (e.g. they include the JS SDK on the page to allow inter-frame communication) sub-applications that then look and feel like part of the larger site, and can access components of them (e.g. an employee lookup dialog).
